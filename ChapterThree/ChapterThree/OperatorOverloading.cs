Operator Overloading:
        -> The concept of function overloading can be applied to operator as well
        -> Operator overloading gives the ability to use same operator to do various operations
        -> It provides additional capabilities to C# operators
           when they are applied to user defined data types
        -> It enables to make user defined implementations of various operations where one of both of the operands are of user defined 
           class
Syntax:
access_specifier  className  operator Operator_symbol (parameters)
{
     Code
}

Various operator available for overloading
1. Unary Operators: +,-,!,~,++,--
2. Binary Operators: +,-,*,/,%
3. Comparison operators: ==, !=
